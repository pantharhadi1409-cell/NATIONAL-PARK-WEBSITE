      <hr>
      <p class="page-content">
        Hingol National Park or Hungol National Park (Urdu: ہنگول نیشنل پارک) is one of the largest national parks in
        Pakistan, located in the Makran coastal region along and to the north of Pakistan's Arabian Sea coast. The park
        covers an area of about 6,100 square kilometres (2,400 sq mi) and is located 190 km from Karachi in the three
        districts of Gwadar, Lasbela and Awaran in Balochistan. Hingol was declared a national park in 1988.

        The park is named after the southern part of the Hingol River, which flows along the shores of the Arabian Sea
        and is home to large numbers of waterfowl and a wealth of marine life. Hangul National Park contains six
        distinct ecosystems, as well as both desert and plains regions, making it unique among the national parks of
        Pakistan.

        The park is bordered by a dense forest to the north, a barren mountain range to the south, and the Hingol River
        tributary, which is home to thousands of migratory birds and marsh crocodiles. The Gulf of Oman and the Arabian
        Sea are to the south.

        The park’s unique rock formations have been attracting tourists from all over the country for some time -
        notably since the completion of the Makran Coastal Highway in 2004.
        Hingol National Park (HNP) is the largest national park in Pakistan, covering an area of
        approximately 6,100 square kilometers (2,400 sq mi). Located in the Makran coastal region of
        Balochistan, it stretches along the Arabian Sea and features a breathtaking mix of deserts,
        mountains, mud volcanoes, and coastal wetlands.

        Established in 1988, Hingol is a land of striking contrasts — from rugged canyons and lunar
        landscapes to turquoise blue rivers cutting through barren cliffs — making it one of the country’s
        most visually stunning and biodiverse regions.

            <h3>Wild Life Of Hingol National park</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>Hingol National Park is a natural sanctuary for endangered wildlife in Pakistan. It is home to about 257
              plant and 289 animal species, including 35 mammals, aquatic animals, amphibians, reptiles and migratory
              birds, including hundreds of rare species. Marsh crocodiles are regularly spotted on the coastline
              adjacent to Hingol National Park, and there are an estimated 60 crocodiles in various places.

              The Hangul Bay has a large number of other aquatic life including Indo-Pacific dolphins and green & olive
              turtles, and various rare species of fish and turtles live in the coastal areas adjacent to Hangul
              National Park. These turtles come to the beach every night in August to lay their eggs at night.
              Increasing plastic pollution on the shores made it difficult for them to dig, so the female turtles left
              without laying eggs. Since then, the number of these turtles on the shores of Sindh and Balochistan has
              dropped significantly.</p>
